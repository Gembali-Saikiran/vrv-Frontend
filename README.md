# **Role-Based Dashboard Application**

This project is a role-based dashboard application created with React. It provides functionality for different user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), allowing role-specific features and access. This demonstrates React's state management, routing, and dynamic user interface capabilities.

## **Features**

### Login Page
- Users log in by entering:
  - **Username**
  - **Password**
  - **Role** (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- Based on the role, users are redirected to their respective dashboards:
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users and view activities.
  - **Editor Dashboard**: Add and update content.
  - **Viewer Dashboard**: View content without editing rights.

### Admin Dashboard
- **Add Users**: Add new users by entering a username and selecting their role.

- **Remove Users**: Delete existing users.
- **Track Activity**: View activity logs of users.

### Editor Dashboard

- **Update Content**: Edit the details of existing articles.
- **No Delete Permission**: Editors cannot delete content.

### Viewer Dashboard
- **View Content**: See the content created by editors.
- **Read-Only Access**: Viewers cannot add, edit, or delete content.
